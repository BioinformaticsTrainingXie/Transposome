Transposome version: $VERSION

USAGE: $prog [-c] [-a] [-int] [-idx] [-edges] [-bdb] [-clsdir] [-v] [-h] [-m]

Required:
    -c|config           :    The Transposome configuration file. This is all that is required to run
                             the full analysis. The options below are for individual analysis steps.

Options:
    -a|analysis         :    The type of analysis to perform (Default: all).
    -int|intfile        :    The file containing an index of each sequence 
                             (only required for the 'cluster' analysis).
    -idx|idxfile        :    The file containing an index mapping the sequence ID and the
                             ID used for clustering (only required for the 'cluster' analysis).
    -edges|edgefile     :    The file containing the best pairwise matches and
                             the score (only required for the 'cluster' analysis).
    -bdb|blastdb        :    The all-vs-all BLAST file (only required for the 'findpairs' analysis).
    -clsdir|clusterdir  :    The directory of FASTA files for each cluster 
                             (only required for the 'annotation' analysis).
    -seqct|sequencect   :    The total number of sequences used in the analysis.
                             (only required for the 'annotation' analysis).
    -clsct|clusteredct  :    The total number of clustered sequences.
                             (only required for the 'annotation' analysis).
    -v|version          :    Print the program version and exit.
    -h|help             :    Print a usage statement.
    -m|man              :    Print the full documentation.

=head1 REQUIRED ARGUMENTS

=over 2

=item -c, --config

The Transposome configuration file.

=back 

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 2

=item -a, --analysis

The type of analysis to perform. Options are 'all', 'blast', 'findpairs', 'cluster', and 'annotation'. Default: all.

    Analysis type         Description

    all                   Run the full analysis from beginning to end, logging progress of each step.
    blast                 Run only the all-vs-all BLAST comparison.
    findpairs             Parse the all-vs-all BLAST report and find best scoring pairwise matches (to be used in graph construction).
    cluster               Perform the clustering step with the pairwise matches.
    annotation            Run the annotation procedures on a directory cluster FASTA files.

The BLAST step can be greatly accelerated by running on a machine with a large number of processors, but the 'findpairs' and 'cluster' steps often require a large amount of computer memory. For this reason, it is best to separate the steps so you can run the BLAST on a large cluster, then send the 'findpairs' and 'cluster' steps to a high memory machine.

Examples:

1) Run the full analysis. In this case, only the configuration file is required.

    transposome --config transposome_config.yml

2) Run just the BLAST step. Only the configuration file is required for this step.

    transposome --analysis blast --config transposome_config.yml

3) Run the 'findpairs' analysis step. For this analysis, the configuration file and an all-vs-all BLAST file is required.

    transposome --analysis findpairs --config transposome_config.yml --blastdb seqs_allvall_blastdb.bln

4) Run the 'cluster' analysis step. In addition to the configuration file, the three files generated by the 'findpairs' step are required. These files are explained in more detail below.

    transposome --analysis cluster --config transposome_config.yml -int seqs_matches.int -idx seqs_matches.idx -edges seqs_matches.edges

5) Run the 'annotation' analysis step. 

    transposome --analysis annotation --config transposome_config.yml -clsdir seqs_clustered_fasta_files -seqct 100000 -clsct 73400

=item -int, --intfile

The file containing the index of each sequence and match score. This is returned from the parse_blast method in the Transposome::Pairfinder class.

=item -idx, --idxfile

The file containing an index mapping the sequence ID and the sequence index used for clustering. This is returned from the parse_blast method in the Transposome::Pairfinder class.

=item -edges, --edgefile

The file containg the pairwise information for each best scoring match. This is returned from the parse_blast method in the Transposome::Pairfinder class.

=item -bdb, --blastdb

The all-vs-all BLAST report generated from the unassembled sequenc reads. This file is returned from the run_allvall_blast method in the Transposome::Run::Blast class.

=item -clsdir, --clusterdir

A directory containing the FASTA files for each cluster. The PATH to this directory is returned from the merge_clusters method in the Transposome::Cluster class.

=item -seqct, --sequencect

The total number of sequences used in the analysis. This is printed to STDERR and printed in the Results section of the log at the conclusion of the 'cluster' analysis. This option is only required for the separate 'annotation' analysis.

=item -clsct, --clusteredct

The total number of clustered sequences. This is printed to STDERR and printed in the Results section of the log at the conclusion of the 'cluster' analysis. This option is only required for the separate 'annotation' analysis.

=item -v, --version

Print the Transposome version and exit.

=item -h, --help

Print a usage statement. 

=item -m, --man

Print the full documentation.
